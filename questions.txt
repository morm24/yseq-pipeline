can I pass wildcard ovewr one rule? 

so rule 1 uses the wildcard YSEQID, 
rule 2 just as input, rule 3 uses them again as in and output.



how can I define a rule, that is just needed, when a certain wildcard has a certain Vlue (download snps only when {REF} is hg38)




all mtDNA scripts shouldnt run, when ref = HS1

The main goal of this script is to change the stnadard mapping script from hg38 to HS1. 

How is the bachelor thesis evaluated? 
Is only the report evaluated, or does the code/Snakemake pipeline also play a (significant) role in the evaluation?
